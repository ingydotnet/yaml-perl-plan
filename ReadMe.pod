=head1 The Plan for YAML and Perl in 2014

Ingy d√∂t Net and David Golden met up in NYC on May 29, 2014 to discuss the
way forward to a better YAML experience in Perl. This document is an overview
of that and this repository is a place to collect all the ideas. The vision
extends beyond YAML (ie serialization via JSON, BSON, ProtoBuf, JSYNC, etc)
and beyond Perl (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, PHP, etc), but YAML+Perl is the
crossroads that we have the most weight in, so we start there (with an eye
towards the bigger picture).
